# Diamond-Dash
2D Game developed in Unity

In this game, you are a miner that has to collect diamonds and crypto coins by digging through different levels. 
You will have to use logic to move stones and clear your path and do you best to beat the timer. There are enemies beneath the ground - giant spiders, that will make you lose the game once they catch you.
